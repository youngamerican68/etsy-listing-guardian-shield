    "content": "Please note that Section 11 of the Terms below contains a binding arbitration agreement and class action waiver for users in North and South America. By agreeing to the Terms, you and Etsy agree to submit any disputes between us exclusively to individual arbitration and not to sue in court, except in the limited circumstances described below.\n\nAccepting These Terms\nThose Other Documents We Mentioned\nYour Privacy\nYour Account with Etsy\nYour Content\nYour Use of Our Services\nTermination\nWarranties and Limitation of Liability (or the Things You Can’t Sue Us For)\nIndemnification (and What Happens If You Get Us Sued)\nDisputes with Other Users\nArbitration and Dispute Resolution Agreement (North and South America)\nDispute Resolution (Rest of World)\nChanges to the Terms\nSome Finer Legal Points\nContact Information\n1. Accepting These Terms\n\nThis document and the other documents that we reference below make up our house rules, or what we officially call our Terms of Use (the “Terms” for short).\n\nThe Terms are a legally binding contract between you and Etsy. If you live in North America or South America, the contract is between you and Etsy, Inc.; if you live elsewhere, the contract is between you and Etsy Ireland UC, a subsidiary of Etsy, Inc. We’ll just refer to Etsy, Inc. and all of its subsidiaries collectively as “Etsy.”\n\nIf you are a buyer on Etsy, the Etsy entity acting as merchant of record may vary depending on the currency and location of your payment instrument. The merchant of record is Etsy, Inc., 117 Adams St, Brooklyn, NY 11201 if you reside in the US; Etsy Ireland UC, One Le Pole Square, Ship Street Great, Dublin 8, Ireland if you reside in the EU; Etsy UK Limited, The Pavilions, Bridgwater Road, Bristol, England BS13 8FD if you reside in the UK (UK); Etsy Canada Limited, 22 Adelaide Street West, Suite 3600, Toronto ON M5H 4E3, if you reside in Canada; Etsy Australia Pty Limited, Yarra Falls, 452 Johnston Street, Abbotsford, Victoria 3067 if you reside in Australia; and Etsy Ireland UC, One Le Pole Square, Ship Street Great, Dublin 8, Ireland, if you reside in the rest of the world.\n\nPlease note that Section 11 contains an arbitration clause and class action waiver, applicable to users in North and South America, and explains how to opt out of arbitration. Unless you validly opt out, you agree to resolve any disputes with Etsy exclusively through binding individual arbitration, with only limited exceptions. This means you and Etsy are waiving the right to sue in court, have a trial by jury, or participate in a class or representative action. Please read this Section carefully, as it affects your rights.\n\nThis contract sets out your rights and responsibilities when you use Etsy.com, Pattern by Etsy, our mobile apps, and the other services provided by Etsy (we’ll refer to all of these collectively as our “Services”), so please read it carefully. By using any of our Services (even just browsing one of our websites or apps), you’re agreeing to the Terms. If you don’t agree with the Terms, you may not use our Services. Agree with us? Great, read on!\n\n2. Those Other Documents We Mentioned\n\nEtsy’s Services connect people around the world, both online and offline, to make, sell, and buy unique goods. Here’s a handy guide to help you understand the specific rules that are relevant for you, depending on how you use the Services:\n\nOur House Rules for Everyone. If you use any of our Services, you agree to these Terms, our Privacy Policy, and our Anti-Discrimination Policy.\n\nOur House Rules for Sellers. If you list any items for sale through our Services, these policies apply to you. You can read them here.\n\nOur House Rules for Buyers. If you use our Services to browse or shop, these policies apply to you. You can read them here.\n\nOur House Rules for Third Parties. These policies apply to intellectual property owners, Etsy API users, affiliates, and anyone requesting information from Etsy.\n\nSearch, Advertising and Recommendation Ranking Disclosures. This is a concise summary of how Etsy organizes search results and advertising results that could include Your Content.\n\nAll of these policies are a part of our Terms, so be sure to read the ones that are relevant for you. Of course, you’ll still want to read the rest of this document because it applies to everyone!\n\n3. Your Privacy\n\nWe know your personal information is important to you, so it’s important to us. Our Privacy Policy details how your information is collected, used and shared when you use our Services. By using our Services, you're also agreeing that we can process your information in the ways set out in the Privacy Policy, so please read it here.\n\nBoth Etsy and sellers process members’ personal information (for example, buyer name, email address, and shipping address) and are therefore considered separate and independent data controllers of buyers’ personal information under EU law. That means that each party is responsible for the personal information it processes in providing the Services. For example, if a seller accidentally discloses a buyer’s name and email address when fulfilling another buyer’s order, the seller, not Etsy, will be responsible for that unauthorized disclosure.  \n\nIf, however, you (as a seller) and Etsy are found to be joint data controllers of buyers’ personal information, and if Etsy is sued, fined, or otherwise incurs expenses because of something that you did (or failed to do) as a joint data controller of buyer personal information, then you agree to defend and indemnify Etsy in accordance with Section 9 below.\n\n4. Your Account with Etsy\n\nYou’ll need to create an account with Etsy to use some of our Services. Here are a few rules about accounts with Etsy:\n\nA. You must be 18 years or older to use our Services. Minors under 18 and at least 13 years of age are only permitted to use our Services through an account owned by a parent or legal guardian with their appropriate permission and under their direct supervision. Children under 13 years are not permitted to use Etsy or the Services. You are responsible for any and all account activity conducted by a minor on your account, and there may be commercial products or services available that you may want to consider to limit a minor's access to material online. For more information, see Etsy's Minors Policy.\n\nB. Be honest with us. Provide accurate information about yourself. It’s prohibited to use false information or impersonate another person or company through your account.\n\nC. Choose an appropriate name. If you decide to not have your full name serve as the name associated with your account, you may not use language that is offensive, vulgar, infringes someone’s intellectual property rights, or otherwise violates the Terms.\n\nD. You're responsible for your account. You’re solely responsible for any activity on your account. If you’re sharing an account with other people, then the person whose financial information is on the account will ultimately be responsible for all activity. If you’re registering as a business entity, you personally guarantee that you have the authority to agree to the Terms on behalf of the business. Accounts are generally not transferable.\n\nE. Protect your password. As we mentioned above, you’re solely responsible for any activity on your account, so it’s important to keep your account password secure. Here’s a Help article on how to make your account more secure.\n\nF. Let's be clear about our relationship. These Terms don't create any agency, partnership, joint venture, employment, or franchisee relationship between you and Etsy.\n\nG. Cases and Appeals. To participate in our case system (as described in Section 10), or to appeal an action by Etsy, you must have an account.\n\nThis detailed Help article should answer any questions you may have about registering an account with Etsy.\n\n5. Your Content\n\nContent that you post using our Services is your content (so let’s refer to it as “Your Content”). We don’t make any claim to it, which includes anything you post using our Services (like shop names, profile pictures, listing photos, listing descriptions, reviews, comments, videos, usernames, etc.).\n\nA. Responsibility for Your Content. You understand that you are solely responsible for Your Content. You represent that you have all necessary rights to all parts of Your Content and that you’re not infringing or violating any third party’s rights by posting it.\n\nB. Permission to Use Your Content. By posting Your Content through our Services, you grant Etsy and, as authorized by Etsy in its sole discretion, third parties, a license to use it. We don’t claim any ownership to Your Content, but we have your permission to use it to help Etsy function and grow. That way, we won’t infringe any rights you have in Your Content and we can help promote it. For example, you acknowledge and agree Etsy may offer you or Etsy buyers promotions on the Site, from time to time, that may relate to your listings or other listings on Etsy.\n\nC. Rights You Grant Etsy. (Here’s the legalese version of the last section). By posting Your Content, you grant Etsy and, as authorized by Etsy in its sole discretion, third parties, a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable, sub-licensable, perpetual license to use, display, edit, modify, reproduce, distribute, store, and prepare derivative works of Your Content. This allows us to provide the Services and to promote Etsy, your Etsy shop, other shops and listings, or the Services in general, in any formats and through any channels, including across any Etsy Services, our partners, or third-party website or advertising medium. You agree not to assert any moral rights or rights of publicity against us for using Your Content. You also recognize our legitimate interest in using it, in accordance with the scope of this license, to the extent Your Content contains any personal information.\n\nThat sounds like a lot, but it’s necessary for us to keep Etsy going. Consider these examples: if you upload a photo or video of a listing on your Etsy shop, we have permission to display it to buyers, and we can resize or enhance it so it looks good to a buyer using our mobile app; if you post a description in English, we can translate it into French so a buyer in Paris can learn the story behind your item; and if you post a beautiful photo or video of your latest handmade necklace, we can feature it– often along with your shop name and shop picture– on our homepage, in one of our blogs or even on a billboard to help promote your business and Etsy’s.\n\nD. Reporting Unauthorized Content. Etsy has great respect for intellectual property rights, and is committed to following appropriate legal procedures to remove infringing content from the Services. If content that you own or have rights to has been posted to the Services without your permission and you want it removed, please follow the steps listed in our Intellectual Property Policy. If Your Content is alleged to infringe another person’s intellectual property, we will take appropriate action, such as disabling it if we receive a report of infringement that complies with our policies, or terminating your account if you are found to be a repeat infringer. We’ll notify you if any of that happens.\n\nE. Inappropriate, False, or Misleading Content. This should be common sense, but there are certain types of content we don’t want posted on Etsy’s Services (for legal reasons or otherwise). You agree that you will not post any content that is abusive, threatening, defamatory, obscene, vulgar, or otherwise offensive or in violation of our Prohibited Items Policy, Community Policy, or any part of our Terms. You also agree not to post any content that is false and misleading or uses the Services in a manner that is fraudulent or deceptive.\n\n6. Your Use of Our Services\n\nLicense to Use Our Services. We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and revocable license to use our Services—subject to the Terms and the following restrictions in particular:\n\nA. Don’t Use Our Services to Break the Law. You agree that you will not violate any laws in connection with your use of the Services. This includes any local, state, federal, and international laws that may apply to you. For example, it’s your responsibility to obtain any permits or licenses that your shop requires, and to meet applicable legal requirements in applicable jurisdiction(s). This includes the sale and delivery of your items, such as age verification upon delivery, where required by law. You may not sell anything that violates any laws; you must comply with our Sanctions Policy, and you may not engage in fraud (including false claims or infringement notices), theft, anti-competitive conduct, threatening conduct, or any other unlawful acts or crimes against Etsy, another Etsy user, or a third party.\n\nB. Pay Your Bills. You are responsible for paying all fees that you owe to Etsy. Except as set forth below, you are also solely responsible for collecting and/or paying any applicable taxes for any purchases or sales you make through our Services. Where applicable, Etsy will calculate, collect and remit value-added tax or VAT and sales tax. Some countries may refer to VAT using other terms, e.g. Goods and Services Tax (GST), but we’ll just refer to VAT, GST, and any local sales taxes collectively as “VAT.” Please see this FAQ and our and our Fees & Payments Policy for more information on taxes, including details on the taxes Etsy collects and remits from the buyers. Your fees, bills, taxes, and how you can pay them are fully explained in our Fees & Payments Policy.\n\nC. Don’t Steal Our Stuff. You agree not to crawl, scrape, or spider any page of the Services or to reverse engineer or attempt to obtain the source code of the Services (including both Etsy Intellectual Property and Seller Content) without our express permission. If you want to use our API, please follow our API Terms of Use.\n\nD. Don’t Try to Harm Our Systems. You agree not to interfere with or try to disrupt our Services, for example by distributing a virus, excessive requests to our site or platform, or other harmful computer code.\n\nE. Follow Our Trademark Policy. The name \"Etsy\" and the other Etsy marks, phrases, logos, and designs that we use in connection with our Services (the Etsy Trademarks), are trademarks, service marks, or trade dress of Etsy in the US and other countries. If you’d like to use our trademarks, you agree to follow our Trademark Policy.\n\nF. Share Your Ideas. We love your suggestions and ideas! They can help us improve your experience and our Services. Any ideas or other materials you submit to Etsy (not including Your Content or items you sell through our Services) are considered non-confidential and non-proprietary to you. You grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable, sub-licensable, perpetual license to use and publish those ideas and materials for any purpose, without compensation to you.\n\nG. Talk to Us Online. From time to time, Etsy will provide you with certain legal information in writing. By using our Services, you’re agreeing to our Electronic Communications Policy, which describes how we provide that information to you. It says that we can send you information electronically (such as by email) instead of mailing you paper copies (it’s better for the environment), and that your electronic agreement is the same as your signature on paper.\n\n7. Termination\n\nTermination By You. We'd hate to see you go, but you may terminate your account with Etsy at any time from your account settings. You can find more information in this Help article. Terminating your account will not affect the availability of some of Your Content that you posted through the Services prior to termination. Oh, and you’ll still have to pay any outstanding bills.\n\nTermination By Etsy. We may terminate or suspend your account (and any accounts Etsy determines are related to your account) and your access to the Services should we have reason to believe you, your Content, or your use of the Services violate our Terms. If we do so, it’s important to understand that you don’t have a contractual or legal right to continue to use our Services, for example, to sell or buy on our websites or mobile apps. Generally, Etsy will notify you that your account has been terminated or suspended, unless you’ve repeatedly violated our Terms or we have legal or regulatory reasons preventing us from notifying you.\n\nIf you or Etsy terminate your account, you may lose any information associated with your account, including Your Content.\n\nWe May Discontinue the Services Etsy reserves the right to change, suspend, or discontinue any of the Services for you, any or all users, at any time, for any reason, including those laid out in Etsy’s policies under these Terms of Use. We will not be liable to you for the effect that any changes to the Services may have on you, including your income or your ability to generate revenue through the Services.\n\nSurvival. The Terms will remain in effect even after your access to the Service is terminated, or your use of the Service ends.\n\n8. Warranties and Limitation of Liability (or the Things You Can’t Sue Us For)\n\nItems You Purchase. You understand that Etsy does not manufacture, store, or inspect any of the items sold through our Services. We provide the venue; the items in our marketplaces are produced, listed, and sold directly by independent sellers, so Etsy cannot and does not make any warranties about their quality, safety, authenticity, or their legality. Any legal claim related to an item you purchase must be brought directly against the seller of the item. You release Etsy from any claims related to items sold through our Services, including for defective items, misrepresentations by sellers, or items that caused physical injury (like product liability claims).\n\nContent You Access. You may come across materials that you find offensive or inappropriate while using our Services. We make no representations concerning any content posted by users through the Services. Etsy is not responsible for the accuracy, copyright compliance, legality, or decency of content posted by users that you accessed through the Services. You release us from all liability relating to that content.\n\nPeople You Interact With. You can use the Services to interact with other individuals, either online or in person. However, you understand that we do not screen users of our Services other than to meet certain compliance and legal obligations, and you release us from all liability relating to your interactions with other users. Please be careful and exercise caution and good judgment in all interactions with others, especially if you are meeting someone in person. This Help article has some good advice about handling in-person meetings.\n\nThird-Party Services. Our Services may contain links to third-party websites or services that we don’t own or control (for example, links to Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest). You may also need to use a third party’s product or service in order to use some of our Services (like a compatible mobile device to use our mobile apps). When you access these third-party services, you do so at your own risk. The third parties may require you to accept their own terms of use. Etsy is not a party to those agreements; they are solely between you and the third party.\n\nPromotions. Etsy special offers or promotions are managed by Etsy in its sole discretion and redemption of and participation in such offers or promotions are subject to Etsy's sole discretion. Etsy is not responsible for special offers or promotions provided by sellers.\n\nWARRANTIES. ETSY IS DEDICATED TO MAKING OUR SERVICES THE BEST THEY CAN BE, BUT WE’RE NOT PERFECT AND SOMETIMES THINGS CAN GO WRONG. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT OUR SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND \"AS AVAILABLE\" WITHOUT ANY KIND OF WARRANTY (EXPRESS OR IMPLIED). WE ARE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMING ANY WARRANTIES OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AS WELL AS ANY WARRANTIES IMPLIED BY A COURSE OF PERFORMANCE, COURSE OF DEALING, OR USAGE OF TRADE.\n\nWE DO NOT GUARANTEE THAT: (I) THE SERVICES WILL BE SECURE OR AVAILABLE AT ANY PARTICULAR TIME OR LOCATION; (II) ANY DEFECTS OR ERRORS WILL BE CORRECTED; (III) THE SERVICES WILL BE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL MATERIALS; OR (IV) THE RESULTS OF USING THE SERVICES WILL MEET YOUR EXPECTATIONS. YOU USE THE SERVICES SOLELY AT YOUR OWN RISK. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\nLIABILITY LIMITS. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NEITHER ETSY (INCLUDING ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SUBSIDIARIES, PARTNERS, OR AFFILIATES) SHALL BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY LOST PROFITS OR REVENUES, OR FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES OR THESE TERMS. IN NO EVENT SHALL ETSY’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ANY DAMAGES EXCEED THE GREATER OF: (A) $100, (B) ANY AMOUNTS DUE UNDER THE ETSY PURCHASE PROTECTION PROGRAM UP TO THE PRICE YOU PAID FOR AN ITEM SOLD BY A THIRD PARTY ON ETSY (INCLUDING ANY APPLICABLE SALES TAX) AND ITS ORIGINAL SHIPPING COSTS, OR (C) THE AMOUNT YOU PAID ETSY IN FEES IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS PRIOR TO ANY ACTION GIVING RISE TO THE LIABILITY. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n9. Indemnification (and What Happens If You Get Us Sued)\n\nWe hope this never happens, but if Etsy gets sued or receives a claim, notice, inquiry or demand because of something that you did (or failed to do), you agree to defend and indemnify us. That means, without limitation, you’ll defend, reimburse, compensate, and hold Etsy (including any of our employees, officers, directors, agents, subsidiaries, and affiliates) harmless from any allegation, claim, demand, lawsuit, loss, liability, or expense of any kind (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) that arises from your actions, your use (or misuse) of our Services, your breach of the Terms, items you buy or sell through the Services, and/or your actual or alleged violation of any law or any third party’s rights. We reserve the right to handle our legal defense however we see fit, even if you are indemnifying us, in which case you agree to cooperate with us so we can execute our strategy.\n\n10. Disputes with Other Users\n\nIf you find yourself in a dispute with another user of Etsy’s Services or a third party, we encourage you to contact the other party and try to resolve the dispute amicably.\n\nCase System. Buyers and sellers who are unable to resolve a dispute related to a transaction on our websites or mobile apps may participate in our case system with a registered account. You can find details about the case system in this Help article. In our sole discretion, Etsy will attempt to help you resolve disputes in good faith, but we will not make judgments or determinations regarding legal issues or claims. Etsy has no obligation to resolve, or to assist in resolving, any disputes.\n\nRelease of Etsy. You release Etsy from any claims, demands, and damages arising out of disputes with other users or third parties.\n\n11. Arbitration and Dispute Resolution Agreement (North and South America)\n\nIf you’re upset with us, let us know, and we’ll work together in good faith to resolve your issue. But if we can’t work it out, then you and Etsy (including our employees, officers, directors, agents, subsidiaries, and affiliates) agree to submit our disputes exclusively to binding individual arbitration, and we won’t sue each other in court before a judge or jury, except in the limited circumstances described below.\n\nThis Section 11 (which we’ll also refer to as the “Arbitration Agreement” or “Agreement”) applies only if you are a user in North or South America, and applies to the fullest extent allowable by law.\n\nPlease read this Section carefully, as it affects your rights.\n\nA. Disputes that We’ll Arbitrate. You and Etsy agree to mandatory individual arbitration for all claims arising from or relating to the Services, these and prior versions of the Terms, any products, data, or content bought, sold, offered, accessed, displayed, transmitted, or listed through the Services, and actions or statements by Etsy or its users, in each case including disputes that arose before the effective date of these Terms (each, a “Dispute”). The exception is that we each may (1) bring qualifying individual claims in “small claims” court, so long as those claims remain in small claims court; and (2) seek injunctive relief in court for infringement or misuse of intellectual property rights (like trademarks, copyrights, and patents). All other Disputes must be arbitrated, which means you and Etsy are each waiving your right to sue in court and have a court or jury trial.\n\nB. Class and Representative Action Waiver. You and Etsy agree that each of us may bring claims against the other only on an individual basis, and not on a class, representative, or collective basis (and we each waive any right we have to bring such claims). We each may only seek or obtain individualized relief, and, except as provided in Section 11.F (Batch Arbitration), disputes between us cannot be arbitrated or consolidated with those of any other person or entity. If there is a final decision (after exhaustion of all appeals) that any part of this Section 11.B is unenforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief (e.g., public injunctive relief), then solely that particular claim or request for relief shall be severed from the arbitration and may be litigated in court (but only after the arbitrator issues an award on the arbitrable claims and remedies).\n\nC. Informal Dispute Resolution. Before filing an arbitration, you and Etsy will try in good faith to resolve any Dispute informally. To start the dispute process, you must send an individualized written notice (“Notice of Dispute”) to disputeresolution@etsy.com that includes (1) your name, phone number, the email address for your account, username and shop name (if applicable), and (2) a description of the Dispute and how you’d like it resolved. If Etsy has a Dispute with you, we will send a Notice of Dispute with the same information to the email address for your account. Once a complete Notice of Dispute has been received, the recipient has 60 days to investigate the claims. If either side requests a settlement conference during this period, then you and Etsy must cooperate to schedule that meeting by phone or videoconference. You and Etsy each will personally participate and can each bring counsel, but the conference must be individualized, even if the same firm(s) represent multiple parties. For the claims in the Notice of Dispute, any statute of limitations will be tolled from the date the notice is received until the later of (i) 60 days, or (ii) after a timely requested settlement conference is completed (“Informal Resolution Period”). An arbitration cannot be filed until the Informal Resolution Period has ended, and a court can enjoin the filing or prosecution of an arbitration in breach of this Section.\n\nD. Arbitration Rules and Procedures. To initiate arbitration, either you or we must file an arbitration demand with the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). You must serve Etsy with any arbitration demand by mail to: Etsy, Inc. c/o United Agent Group Inc., 1521 Concord Pike, Suite 201, Wilmington, DE 19803. If Etsy has a dispute with you, we will send an arbitration demand to the email address for your account. If the AAA cannot or will not administer the arbitration in accordance with Section 11, you and we will select another provider (and if we can’t agree, a court will choose the provider).\n\nThe arbitration will be conducted in the English language by a single arbitrator. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties or ordered by the arbitrator, (i) if the amount in dispute is less than $25,000, the arbitration will be conducted as a documents-only arbitration (i.e., there will be no in-person or telephonic hearing); and (ii) if the amount in dispute is $25,000 or more, the arbitration will be held by videoconference (i.e., there will be no in-person hearing). If an in-person hearing is required, it will be held in the county where you live (for US residents), New York County, New York (for non-US residents), or as determined by the arbitrator (in the case of Batch Arbitration).\n\nThe arbitration will be decided under AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules, as modified by this Agreement. But if you are using the Services as a business (e.g., a seller or developer) and either your or Etsy’s claims exceed $75,000, the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply, as modified by this Agreement. As in court, the arbitrator shall apply governing law and any counsel must comply with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b); and the arbitrator may impose any sanctions available under the AAA Rules, Rule 11, or other applicable law. The arbitrator also shall enforce statutes of limitations and other time-based defenses, offers of judgment/compromise, and fee-shifting rules in the same way as a court would.\n\nThe arbitrator will have exclusive authority to resolve all issues, except that a court has exclusive authority to decide issues related to the arbitrability of a dispute, the enforceability of any part of this Section 11 (Arbitration and Dispute Resolution Agreement (North and South America)), and either party’s compliance with Section 11.C (Informal Dispute Resolution). Except as provided in Section 11.F (Batch Arbitration), the arbitrator can award damages and other relief only in favor of the individual claimant, and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim(s). The arbitrator will not be bound by decisions reached in other arbitrations. The arbitrator’s award is final and binding on you and Etsy. Judgment on the award may be entered in any court with jurisdiction.\n\nE. Arbitration Fees. Payment of all filing, case-management, administrative, hearing, and arbitrator fees (“Arbitration Fees”) will be governed by the AAA’s rules and fee schedules, unless otherwise stated in this Arbitration Agreement. If you are using the Services as a consumer and your share of Arbitration Fees is more than you’d otherwise pay in court, let us know, and Etsy will pay the difference on your behalf.\n\nF. Batch Arbitration. To ensure efficient resolution, if within a 90-day period, 25 or more claimants submit Notices of Dispute or file arbitrations raising similar claims (i.e., with the same or similar facts or events and legal issues) and are represented by the same or coordinated counsel, the disputes must be arbitrated in batches of up to 100 claimants each (“Batch”). Specifically, upon notice from either side, the AAA shall group the claimants into: (1) a single Batch (if there are 25-100 claimants), or (2) Batches of 100 claimants each, with a smaller, final Batch consisting of any remaining claimants (if there are more than 100 claimants). The AAA shall thereafter provide for the resolution of each Batch as a single consolidated arbitration with a single arbitrator appointed by the AAA, one set of Arbitration Fees, and one hearing (if any) per Batch to be held by videoconference (or in a place decided by the arbitrator). The parties will cooperate in good faith to implement this process and minimize the time and costs of arbitration, and agree that the AAA Mass Arbitration Supplementary Rules shall apply, except as provided in this Section. Any challenges to administrative determinations by AAA shall be heard by a single process arbitrator. If this Section 11.F is deemed unenforceable as to a particular claimant or Batch, then it shall be severed as to that claimant or Batch, and those parties shall arbitrate in individual proceedings.\n\nG. Opt out. If you are a new user of our Services, you can opt out of this Arbitration Agreement (excluding Section 11.I) within 30 days after you first accept the Terms. To opt out, you must send a timely email to arbitrationoptout@etsy.com with your name, the email address for your account, your username and your shop name (if applicable), and a request to opt out of arbitration. If you validly opt out, neither Etsy nor you will be required to arbitrate as a result of this (or any prior version of the) Arbitration Agreement, but the Terms (and any other agreements between us) will otherwise apply to you. If we update the Terms after you validly opt out, we will continue to respect your opt-out, but such updates do not provide a new opportunity to opt out of arbitration.\n\nH. Future Changes to the Arbitration Agreement. Etsy will notify you of material changes to this Arbitration Agreement at least 30 days before they become effective. You may reject future changes to the Arbitration Agreement by emailing arbitrationchanges@etsy.com within 30 days after you receive notice, including your name, email address associated with your account, your username, and shop name (if applicable). Otherwise, you’ll be bound by the change, and the modified Arbitration Agreement shall apply to all Disputes between you and Etsy, including those arising before the effective date of the changes, but excluding any claims pending in arbitration (or court, if permitted) as of the effective date. If you reject a change, you’ll be bound by the most recent version of the Arbitration Agreement before the change you rejected.\n\nI. Choice of Law and Forum. Etsy is based in New York, so if there are claims between you and Etsy that aren’t subject to arbitration, you and Etsy each agree to litigate those claims exclusively in state or federal court in New York County, New York, and to submit to the personal jurisdiction of those courts. The exception is if you file in small claims court–you can do that in the county of your residence. Except as prohibited by law, these Terms shall be governed exclusively by New York law, without regard to conflict-of-law rules, and U.S. federal law (including the Federal Arbitration Act). However, if you are based in Canada, you may instead bring any non-arbitrable claims in the courts and under the laws (including federal law) of either Quebec (if you are an individual or sole proprietor in Quebec), or Ontario. For clarity, this Section 11.I will continue to apply even if you validly opt out of arbitration under Section 11.G.\n\n12. Dispute Resolution (Rest of World)\n\nThis Section 12 applies if your country of principal residence or establishment is within Europe (including the European Economic Area, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom), Asia, Australia, or Africa. Because your contract is with Etsy Ireland UC, we each agree that the Terms and any disputes between us will be exclusively governed by Irish law, and exclusively decided in the courts of Ireland, except to the extent prohibited by law. However, if you are based in Australia, the Terms and any disputes will be governed by the laws and courts of Australia. If you are using the Services as an individual consumer, you may be entitled to invoke the mandatory consumer protection laws of your country of residence, and/or to bring legal proceedings in the courts of that country. If Etsy needs to enforce its rights against you as an individual consumer, we will do so only in your country of residence. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG) is excluded.\n\nIf a dispute arises between you and Etsy, we encourage you to contact Etsy Support to seek a resolution, and/or to follow the Informal Dispute Resolution process outlined in Section 11.C above. For EU sellers, Etsy provides a complaint-handling system that is available free of charge and easily accessible. Information about the Platform-to-Business (“P2B”) Regulation is here, including information about how we handle complaints. You may raise a concern or complaint related to P2B here. You or Etsy also may refer qualifying disputes to mediation before the Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution or resolution through the European Commission's online dispute resolution platform. For users covered by the EU Digital Services Act, if you disagree with a decision that Etsy has taken on your content or account or in response to a DSA notice, you may choose to appeal such decisions directly with Etsy. You may also be entitled to engage with a certified out-of-court dispute settlement body. If any of the certified out-of-court dispute settlement bodies need to contact Etsy, we ask that you please contact legal@etsy.com.\n\n13. Changes to the Terms\n\nWe may update these Terms from time to time, including by adding entirely new terms and deleting existing terms. If the changes are material, we’ll let you know in advance by posting the changes through the Services and/or sending you an email or message about the changes. Your use of the Services after the effective date of the changes constitutes your acceptance of the updated Terms. If you do not agree with the changes, you may close your account.\n\n14. Some Finer Legal Points\n\nThe Terms, including all of the policies that make up the Terms, supersede any other agreement between you and Etsy regarding the Services. Except as provided in Section 11, if any part of the Terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable, that part will be limited to the minimum extent necessary and severed so that the Terms will otherwise remain in full force and effect. Our failure to enforce any part of the Terms is not a waiver of our right to later enforce that or any other part of the Terms. We may assign any of our rights and obligations under the Terms.\n\n15. Contact Information\n\nIf you have any questions about the Terms, please email us at legal@etsy.com.\n\nLast updated on Mar 4, 2025"

    "content": "Etsy is not a curated marketplace. However, for a variety of reasons, we prohibit certain types of items from Etsy. Some items present legal risks to our community; others are inconsistent with our values, are harmful to our members, or simply are not in the spirit of Etsy. This policy explains what is prohibited or restricted on Etsy.\nWe have a zero tolerance policy for prohibited items, particularly those that promote, support or glorify hatred, those that promote, support or glorify violence, or are unlawful. Sellers deemed to violate this policy can be subject to immediate account suspension or termination, in accordance with our Terms of Use.\n\nThis policy is a part of our Terms of Use. By opening an Etsy shop, you’re agreeing to this policy and our Terms of Use. If Etsy has reason to believe you, your content, or your use of the Services violate our Terms, we may deactivate your content to some or all buyers or suspend or terminate your account (and any accounts Etsy determines is related to your account) and your access to the Services. Generally, Etsy will notify you that your content or account has been suspended or terminated, unless you’ve repeatedly violated our Terms or we have legal or regulatory reasons preventing us from notifying you.\n\nThe following types of items are prohibited or restricted on Etsy:\n\nAlcohol, Tobacco, Drugs, Drug Paraphernalia, Medical Drugs and Devices, and Items making Medical Claims\nAnimal Products and Human Body Parts and Fluids\nDangerous Items: Hazardous Materials and Devices, Recalled Items, and Weapons\nHate Items: Items that Promote, Support, or Glorify Hatred\nIllegal Items, Items Promoting Illegal Activity, and Highly Regulated Items\nInternationally Regulated Items\nNudity and Sexual Content\nViolent Items: Items that Promote, Support, or Glorify Violence\nPolicy decisions are complex. We consider many different and often divergent factors before coming to a decision about what is best for our community. Because we are a creative community, we err on the side of freedom of expression. We also tend to allow items that have educational, historical, or artistic value, but we know that even those items are subject to a variety of valid and sometimes conflicting interpretations and emotional responses.\n\nArt and history can be provocative, emotional, and divisive. There are some topics on which we may never reach a consensus as a community, and that is okay. In the words of Joyce Carol Oates, “art should not be comforting; for comfort, we have mass entertainment and one another. Art should provoke, disturb, arouse our emotions, expand our sympathies in directions we may not anticipate and may not even wish.”\n\nIn order to help provide clarity and insight into our policy making process, we have included the rationale behind our decisions and details about how they will be enforced, including some representative examples below of what is allowed on Etsy. We reserve the right to remove listings that we determine are not within the spirit of Etsy. Violating this policy may result in the member's selling privileges being suspended and/or terminated.\n\n1. Alcohol, Tobacco, Drugs, Drug Paraphernalia, and Medical Drugs and Devices, and Items making Medical Claims\n\nAlcohol, tobacco, and drugs are prohibited on Etsy. These items may be subject to legal requirements and, in some cases, are considered controlled substances under applicable law.\n\nOur policy also applies to medical drugs, medical devices, and any other item that claims to treat, prevent, mitigate, cure, or diagnose a disease or medical condition. Possible legal restrictions aside, these items are not in the spirit of Etsy.\n\nMore Details:\nThe following are examples of items that may not be sold on Etsy:\n\nAlcohol.\nTobacco products, smokeable products, e-cigarettes, and e-liquid.\nDrugs and certain herbal substances, including substances used for recreational and medicinal purposes, regardless of their legality. We prohibit depictions of these substances in listing photos, as well as listings for instructions or materials intended to create such items.\nDrug paraphernalia, including, for example: items with a carburetor; slides and/or items with a slide; bongs and bubblers; vaporizers and their components.\nMedical drugs and regulated medical devices\nItems making certain medical claims.\nExamples of What is Allowed:\nBeer brewing kits\n\nBeer brewing kits\nBaked goods containing alcohol\n\nRum cake\nExample: Mini Baba au Rum Cake\nHookahs\n\nVintage hookah\nExample: Vintage Hookah\nTobacco pipes\n\nTobacco pipe\nEmpty alcohol bottles and items made from them\n\nWine bottle tray\nExample: Wine Bottle Serving Tray\nResources: Small Business Assistance from the Food & Drug Administration; US FDA and FTC for information about medical claims; US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives\n\n2. Animal Products and Human Body Parts and Fluids\n\nCertain human and animal products are highly regulated and prohibited on Etsy due to the risk of harm to live, companion, or at-risk animals.\n\nMore Details:\nThe following are examples of animal products that may not be sold on Etsy:\n\nLive animals.\nItems created using any endangered or threatened animal species or certain at-risk animals. We define these as animal species designated as threatened or endangered by the US Endangered Species Act or listed in Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), as well as certain additional at-risk animals. Click here for more details about which animals we prohibit.\nItems made from cat and dog parts or pelts as defined by US Federal Law.\nIvory or bones from ivory-producing animals, including tusks, elk ivory, fossilized ivory, and wooly mammoth ivory.\nHuman remains, products, or parts from the human body\nExceptions: Teeth, nails, hair, and non-consumable items made with breast-milk\nExamples of What is Allowed:\nNon-Ivory Animal Bones and Antlers\n\nSnake bone necklace\nExample: Snake Bone Necklace\nLeather Goods\n\nLeather bag\nExample: Leather Bag\nTextiles Made from Animal Hair\n\nAuthentic mohair scarf\nExample: Authentic Mohair Scarf\nHuman Teeth or Hair\n\nMini bottle with human hair\nExample: Mini Bottle with Human Hair\nResources: Endangered Species Act; Prohibition on Importation of Dog and Cat Fur Products\n\nWe expect all of our members to follow their local laws. If you are shipping items across international borders you should also consult CITES for specific information about importing and exporting species that may be threatened. If you sell products containing feathers, you should also consult the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.\n\n3. Dangerous Items: Hazardous Materials and Devices, Recalled Items, and Weapons\n\nFor safety and legal reasons, we prohibit certain dangerous items from our marketplace.\n\nMore details:\nHazardous Materials and Devices\n\nDue to the potential harm caused by hazardous materials and devices, as well as complex legal and shipping regulations surrounding such materials, hazardous materials and devices are prohibited on Etsy. We also prohibit kits, instructions, patterns, and designs enabling the creation of these items.\n\nWhile not exhaustive, the following materials and devices are examples of prohibited items:\n\nExplosives (fireworks or sparklers)\nExplosive precursors\nFlammable items\nGases\nRadioactive material\nToxic substances (such as poisons)\nIndividual or loose lithium ion batteries\nElectric mobility devices (such as bikes, scooters, and mopeds)\nElectric mobility device batteries, chargers, and accessories that aid in their function\nSome ingredients are considered hazardous when found in certain contexts. For more information, please see our Seller Handbook articles about cleaning supplies and cosmetics products. We’ve also put together a list of ingredients that cannot be used in cosmetic items on Etsy, here.\n\nRecalled Items or Items that May Pose a Health or Safety Hazard\n\nItems that have been recalled by governments or manufacturers are prohibited from being sold on Etsy. A few examples of items that have been recalled are certain vintage Corning Ware percolators, lawn darts, and drop side cribs.\n\nItems that may pose a health or safety hazard are prohibited, even if they have not been the subject of a recall. This would include, for example, items that present a choking, electrocution, or strangulation hazard. We rely on information from user reports and various government agencies to identify these items.\n\nEtsy prohibits certain loose or separable high-powered magnets that fit into a 2.25 inches long and 1.25 inches wide “small parts” cylinder and have a flux of 50 kG2 mm2 or more, because of the safety risk they pose if swallowed.\n\nFor more information about reporting unsafe products and recalls for certain markets, please see our Unsafe or Recalled Products page.\n\nWeapons\n\nRead Etsy's full policy on weapons here.\n\nContext matters when it comes to defining what is or is not a weapon. When in doubt, it’s safe to assume that we won’t allow any item intended to be used as a weapon to inflict harm. The following items are generally not allowed on Etsy:\n\nGuns, knives, or other blatant weapons, even if they are vintage.\nImitation firearms and weapons that look real or are prohibited by US law\nPatterns, designs, plans, or instructions, for the creation of prohibited weapons\nExamples of What is Allowed:\nCulinary knives or other knives used as tools\n\nVintage culinary knife\nExample: Vintage Kitchen Knives - Collectibles\nLetter openers\n\nLetter opener\nToy slingshots\n\nToy slingshot\nAirsoft guns and other non-harmful toy guns (with some restrictions)\n\nVintage ray gun toy\nExample: Vintage Ray Gun - Toy\nResources: Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; FMCSA’s Guide to Complying with Federal Hazardous Materials Regulations; US Federal Government's Guide to Recalled Items; US Code of Federal Regulations on Imitation Firearms; US Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act (CPSIA); Australian Competition & Consumer Commission's (ACCC) Product Safety; ACCC Product Bans; European Commission's Consumer Product Safety; US Consumer Product Safety Commission's Resellers Guide to Selling Safer Products; Health Canada Consumer Product Safety\n\n4. Hate Items: Items that Promote, Support, or Glorify Hatred\n\nWe want Etsy to be a community where people of all backgrounds, nationalities, religions, and even different types of artistic taste and humor feel welcome. Art is incredibly subjective, and what is offensive to one is not necessarily offensive to others.\n\nMore Details:\nEtsy does not allow items or listings with violent or degrading language toward people based upon: race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, gender, gender identity, disability, sexual orientation, immigration status, or caste (collectively, “protected classes”). We also prohibit items or content that promote organizations with such views.\n\nThe following items are not allowed on Etsy:\n\nContent which directly or indirectly contains violent or degrading commentary against protected classes\nItems that support or commemorate current or historical hate groups or their leaders, including propaganda or collectibles. Examples of hate groups include Nazi or Neo-Nazi groups, Ku Klux Klan (KKK) groups, white supremacist groups, misogynist groups, or groups that advocate anti-gay, anti-immigrant, or Holocaust denial agendas.\nItems that contain slurs or derogatory terms in reference to protected classes.\nExamples of What is Allowed:\nSome items may contain symbols or terms associated with hateful rhetoric in a context unrelated to hateful intent. We understand that these items are subject to a variety of valid and often conflicting interpretations of their educational, historical and artistic value. Recognizing that there may be no consensus on their value, we reserve the right to evaluate such items on an individual, case-by-case basis.\n\nA note on swastikas:\nWe are sensitive to the fact that there are many cultures throughout the world which use the swastika for legitimate purposes completely independent of Nazism. However, due to the widespread recognition of the Nazi swastika as a hate symbol, we have decided to only allow swastikas when part of a clear religious or cultural context.\n\nVintage Buddhist swastika pendant\nExample: Vintage Buddhist Swastika Pendant\nExample: Buddhist Swastika Necklace\nExample: Buddhist Swastika Necklace\nExample: Tunic with Spiritual Symbols\nExample: Tunic with Spiritual Symbols\nExample: Hindu Brass Sculpture\nExample: Hindu Brass Sculpture\nResources: Federal Bureau of Investigation’s webpage on Hate Crimes; Southern Poverty Law Center\n\n5. Illegal Items, Items Promoting Illegal Activity, and Highly Regulated Items\n\nWe respect the law and expect Etsy sellers to respect the law as well.\n\nMore Details:\nIllegal items, items that promote illegal activity, and stolen items are not allowed on Etsy. Neither are certain items that are subject to complex legal regulations or registration systems. We require sellers to follow all applicable laws for the items they list. Listings may be unavailable for users in regions where the item is restricted to purchase or sell.\n\nEtsy works with law enforcement to take action on stolen property. Stolen goods may be reported to Etsy by contacting us at legal@etsy.com. If you suspect stolen property on Etsy, we also recommend that you report it to local law enforcement. California residents may report stolen goods on the California Office of the Attorney General's Organized Retail Crime Webform.\n\nWhile not exhaustive, examples of items which may be subject to regulation include:\n\nNative American crafts\nPlants and seeds\nChildren's products\nFood products\nIndia Restrictions\nLifesaving and Personal Protective Equipment\nSee the linked pages for more information on requirements and specific items Etsy prohibits in these categories.\n\nBecause Etsy is a global company, it’s important to abide by the laws of the markets in which you are selling. What is legal in one country may be illegal in another. All forms of illegal activity are strictly prohibited. This includes, but is not limited to the sale of:\n\nUnauthorized or counterfeit goods\nPersonal information\nHighly regulated items, such as currency and real estate\nListings which facilitate or promote illegal activity, such as:\n      a. Impersonation\n      b. Evasion of the detection of illegal activity\n      c. Falsified qualifications\nUnauthorized replicas or copies of items, and patterns or designs enabling their creation, are prohibited on Etsy. We consider counterfeit or unauthorized goods to be items that imitate an authentic good, particularly by using a brand’s name, logo, or protected design without the brand owner’s consent. Additionally, we may consider up-cycled or re-purposed items, even if using authentic materials, to be counterfeit if they are making use of a brand's name, logo, or protected design without their permission. Examples of prohibited counterfeit or unauthorized goods include replica luxury and non-luxury items like bags and branded apparel.\n\nWe also prohibit content which infringes on the privacy, publicity, and personal rights of others.\n\nPersonal information may not be sold, for instance as part of a data bank or mailing list. The sale of personal or government documents, such as credit cards, identification cards, and licenses is also prohibited.\n\nGiven associated regulations, lottery tickets, cryptocurrency mining rigs, and current, exchangeable currency and postage may not be sold on Etsy. We also prohibit the sale of financial instruments such as stocks, bonds, and other securities. Items made by a seller containing any of these items in a usable condition are also not allowed. Collectible postage or currency that priced at less than 1,000 USD are allowed unless subject to legal or other restrictions. Collectible currency may not be offered as 'unsearched' or as a mixed lot of unknown contents. Additionally, due to complex legal restrictions that vary by location, Etsy does not permit the sale of real estate, or motor vehicles (for example: automobiles, motorcycles, boats, travel trailers, etc.).\n\nItems may not aid in impersonation. We prohibit realistic items that identify the wearer as an active law enforcement, military, or government official.\n\nWe prohibit items which are intended to evade the detection of illegal activity, such as radar detectors, license plate covers, and materials for faking drug tests.\n\nWe also prohibit certain items that may be used for falsified qualifications. This includes rideshare company decals, diplomas for higher learning or professional licenses, and bank statements and pay stubs, including templates. Consequently, items meant to fraudulently deceive others about one’s medical status are prohibited. This includes items such as fraudulent test results, or items designating an animal as a service animal. We also prohibit items which deceptively infringe on someone’s privacy, such as concealed cameras or tracking devices, and lockpicking devices.\n\n6. Internationally Regulated Items\n\nEtsy provides a direct connection between buyers and sellers around the world. If you buy or sell an item from another country, or if you enter into a transaction with someone across international borders, you are responsible for complying with laws and regulations of the country of destination as well as your local laws.\n\nMore Details:\nWhen buying and selling internationally, you should comply with your local laws and be aware that other countries may have their own restrictions. You might be prohibited from exporting or importing certain items under international laws and regulations. Some transactions may require licenses, permits, or other documentation. If you have questions about how to comply with the law, we recommend that you speak to a qualified professional.\n\nWhen you use Etsy’s services, you are also responsible for complying with economic sanctions and trade restrictions, including those implemented by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (\"OFAC\") of the US Department of the Treasury. All Etsy members must comply with our Sanctions Policy, regardless of their location.\n\nEtsy reserves the right to request that sellers provide additional information, disclose an item's country of origin in a listing, or take other steps to meet compliance obligations.\n\nYou should be aware that third-party payment processors, such as PayPal, may independently monitor transactions for sanctions compliance and may block some transactions as part of their own compliance programs. Etsy has no authority or control over the independent decision-making of these providers.\n\nExamples of What is Allowed:\nSanctions or compliance programs may have certain exceptions to their restrictions. For example, while OFAC broadly prohibits transactions involving goods that originate from sanctioned areas, there are exceptions for informational materials such as publications, films, posters, phonograph records, photographs, tapes, compact disks, and certain artworks. Items that don’t originate from a sanctioned area but make a reference to a sanctioned area are generally permitted.\n\nItems that aren’t from Cuba, but are Cuban style, such as “Cuban Style Fedora Hats”\n\nCuban style fedora hat\nExample: Cuban Style Fedora Hat\nInformational materials such as art, books, film, photos, or music\n\nVintage biography of Fidel Castro\nExample: Vintage Biography of Fidel Castro\nResources: US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) Sanctions\n\n7. Nudity and Sexual Content\n\nWe work hard to balance keeping our community safe while allowing creative expression. We prohibit pornography, sexual services, illegal or exploitative items, and some types of adult toys. In some cases, adult nudity is permitted, though we require some photos to be obscured as a heads-up to people who may not want to see this type of content. If your listings contain mature content, which includes photographic depictions of breasts and buttocks, we ask that you be respectful of differing sensibilities and require you to list and tag your items properly.\n\nMore Details:\nWe prohibit items which are not aligned with Etsy’s brand and values, or which carry legal or other restrictions. Depictions of the sexualization of minors are prohibited, and more information about our policies for depicting minors can be found here.\n\nRead more about our Adult Nudity and Sexual Content Policy. For information on nudity that must be obscured in the first listing image, please read Listing Mature Content Correctly.\n\nExamples of What is Allowed:\nIllustrative (i.e. non-photographic or photorealistic) artwork depicting female nipples\n\nNude painting\nExample: Nude painting\nIllustrative artwork depicting buttocks\n\nNude watercolor painting\nExample: Nude watercolor painting\nIllustrative depictions of genitalia without sexual context\n\nP penis shaped lollipops\nExample: Penis shaped lollipops\nResources: Adult Nudity and Sexual Content on Etsy; Listing Mature Content Correctly\n\n8. Violent Items: Items that Promote, Support, or Glorify Violence\n\nWe want Etsy to be a safe place for everyone. While violent content can be a legitimate part of historical, educational, or artistic expression, it should never be used to promote or glorify violent acts against others.\n\nMore Details:\nWe do not allow items or listings that promote, support or glorify acts of violence or harm towards self, others, or animals, including credible threats of harm.\n\nThe following items are not allowed on Etsy:\n\nItems that glorify human suffering or tragedies, including items that praise or honor perpetrators of violence\nItems that glorify or celebrate real world incidents of violence or natural disasters\nItems that threaten or encourage credible acts of violence against individuals or groups\nItems that promote or support terrorism or terrorist organizations\nItems that encourage self-mutilation, starvation, or other self-harm\nItems that promote or endorse harmful misinformation\nGraphic materials, such as items with violent, gory, or profane text or imagery, must follow our policy for Listing Mature Content Correctly.\n\nExamples of What is Allowed:\nCommemoration of violent events, without glorification\n\nwwi_relic\nExample: A World War I Relic\nItems with violent rhetoric but vague or nonspecific statements that do not indicate a credible threat\n\nviolent_shirts\nExamples: Shirts with violent rhetoric that do not suggest a credible threat of real-world harm\nItems making light of violent incidents or perpetrators, without glorifying or praising them.\n\nWe hope these guidelines are helpful, but we cannot catalog every permitted or prohibited item. If you see something on Etsy that appears to violate these rules, you can report it to us. At the bottom of a listing page, you can click Report this item to Etsy. To report copyright or intellectual property infringement, please follow the instructions in Etsy's Intellectual Property Policy."

By listing items for sale on Etsy, you agree to adhere to this policy and our Terms of Use.\n\nbanner\nWe believe that every item on Etsy should reflect the creativity of our community.

    "content": "As a venue for artists, designers, and makers, Etsy takes intellectual property rights very seriously. We comply with intellectual property laws and industry best practices in order to maintain the integrity of our creative marketplace. This Intellectual Property Policy explains how we address allegations of infringement, how authorized parties can submit reports of infringement regarding content on our marketplace, and how Etsy sellers can respond when their listings or shops are affected by a report.\nThis policy was published on June 15, 2023, and will take effect on July 24, 2023. The previous version of this policy can be viewed here.\n\nFor more information on use of Etsy's intellectual property, including guidelines for the use of Etsy's Trademarks and brand, please refer to Etsy's Trademark Policy\n\nThis policy is a part of our Terms of Use.\n\n   1. Etsy's Role\n   2. Reports of Intellectual Property Infringement\n   3. Counter Notices\n   4. Repeat Infringement\n   5. Withdrawals\n   6. Resources\n\n1. Etsy's Role\nEtsy is a marketplace comprised of individual third¬-party sellers who run their own shops, create their own policies, and are responsible for their inventory, shipments, and complying with the law. We provide a venue, but Etsy does not manufacture goods, hold inventory, or ship items on behalf of our sellers. The content uploaded on Etsy's marketplace is generated by independent sellers who are not employees, agents, or representatives of Etsy. Sellers are responsible for ensuring they have all necessary rights to their content and that they are not infringing or violating any third party’s rights by posting it.\n\nEtsy reserves the right to disable any listing, shop, or account that we believe violates our Terms of Use, including this Intellectual Property Policy or our Prohibited Items Policy. Etsy also reserves the right to take action against abusers of Etsy’s Intellectual Property Policy or our Terms of Use.\n\nEtsy can’t speak on behalf of intellectual property owners, nor is Etsy in a position to offer legal advice or make legal determinations whether a shop’s content infringes someone else’s intellectual property. Etsy will remove material cited for alleged intellectual property infringement when provided with a report that complies with our policies.\n\n2. Reports of Intellectual Property Infringement\nEtsy strives to respond quickly when we receive a report of intellectual property infringement that complies with our policies by removing or disabling access to the allegedly infringing material. When Etsy removes or disables access in response to a report, Etsy makes a reasonable attempt to contact the affected member, provide information about the report and removal, and, in cases of alleged copyright infringement, provide information about how to submit a counter notice. Etsy may also provide a copy of the infringement report, including the name and email address of the reporting party, to the affected member.\n\nTo submit a report of alleged infringement against Etsy shop listings, you can use the Etsy Reporting Portal. This is the easiest way to report alleged infringement to Etsy and its Designated Agent under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and other intellectual property rights.\n\nTo submit a report of alleged infringement against usernames, shop names, videos on an Etsy shop page, or videos from an Explore post on Etsy, use Etsy’s Reporting Form.\n\nIf you are unable to use the Etsy Reporting Portal, you can read more about our DMCA notice requirements and Designated Agent here.\n\nEtsy may request additional information before processing a report, such as a letter of authorization from the rights owner, identity verification of the reporting party, or other documentation regarding the claimed right. Etsy may reject reports of infringement or counter notices that contain information we believe is false, fraudulent, incomplete, or otherwise submitted in bad faith. Etsy also reserves the right to take action against abusers of this policy.\n\n3. Counter Notice\nIn accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), Etsy accepts counter notices for US-based copyright infringement reports only. When Etsy receives a DMCA counter notice, we will provide a copy of the counter notice to the original complaining party. The removed material may be replaced or access to it may be restored 10 business days after the counter notice is processed, unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order restraining the allegedly infringing party from relisting the items or a qualifying action with the Copyright Claims Board (CCB), and informs Etsy of this action. Read more about DMCA notices, counter notices, and requirements here.\n\n4. Repeat Infringement\nEtsy terminates selling privileges of members who are subject to repeat or multiple notices of intellectual property infringement in appropriate circumstances and at Etsy’s discretion. If we believe a member has attempted to open a new shop after termination of the initial account, we reserve the right to refuse all services to that member. These actions apply to any accounts we believe are associated with or operated by the affected member. Per our Terms of Use, Etsy reserves the right to terminate account privileges at any time, for any reason, and without advance notice.\n\n5. Withdrawals\nEtsy only accepts withdrawals of infringement reports directly from the intellectual property owner or authorized representative who submitted the claim. The withdrawal must clearly state that it is a formal withdrawal and sufficiently identify the member and/or material (such as by providing the username, shop name, and Etsy listing URLs).\n\nOnce Etsy receives a formal withdrawal of an infringement report, Etsy will contact the withdrawing party to confirm receipt and will notify the affected member of the withdrawal. Please note that infringement matters are reviewed on a case-by-case basis, and withdrawals do not guarantee changes to a member's shop status.\n\n6. Resources\nIf material was removed from your shop due to a report of infringement, or if you would like to learn more about intellectual property issues in general, please refer to the following information:\n\nSupport for intellectual property issues\n\nFrequently asked questions about having material removed due to a report of infringement.\n\nSeller Handbook articles on legal topics\n\nLast updated on Jun 15, 2023"

    "content": "Sellers may be charged for using some of Etsy’s services. This Fees & Payments Policy explains your fees and taxes and how to pay them.\nThis policy is a part of our Terms of Use. By opening an Etsy shop, you’re agreeing to this policy and our Terms of Use.\n\nTypes of Fees\nOff-Platform Transactions\nPaying Your Etsy Fees\nEtsy Payments\nTaxes\nOther Governmental Fees, Charges and Levies\nMarketplace Reporting of Seller Information\nEtsy Gift Cards, Etsy Credits, and Etsy Coupons\n1. Types of Fees\n\nSellers may be required to pay the following types of fees. Please note that all fees are listed exclusive of any value-added tax (VAT) or similar taxes that may apply. See the Taxes section below for further details. It's important to note that all service fees, including prepaid fees, are non-refundable.\n\nSet-Up Fee\nTo open your Etsy shop, you may be required to pay a one-time set-up fee. Please note that if applicable, the set-up fee will be displayed and charged as part of the shop set-up process. During onboarding and upon your confirmation of this charge, we will initiate a pending transaction on your card. This transaction will be processed after onboarding is complete, your shop is open, and you are able to receive orders on Etsy. By providing your card information and approving the set-up fee, you authorize us to charge your designated payment method. The one-time set-up fee is non-refundable once paid. We reserve the right to adjust or change the set-up fee at our discretion. In certain circumstances or promotional periods, the set-up fee may be waived at our sole discretion. The set-up fee is listed exclusive of any taxes that may apply and depending on the location of your bank account, you may incur additional charges for taxes on this fee at a later time, in accordance with local regulations. Any taxes, where applicable will be reflected in your payment account and deducted from sales. See the Taxes section and the Currency Conversion section below for more details on the set-up fee.\n\nListing Fees\nYou will be charged a listing fee of $0.20 USD for each item that you list for sale on Etsy.com or Etsy's mobile apps. For items already listed on your Etsy shop, there are no additional listing fees to list items on your Pattern site. Listings that you only make available on your Pattern site do not incur a listing fee. You will only be charged a listing fee for creating or renewing a listing on Etsy; there is no fee for editing a listing. You will be charged a listing fee whether or not the listed item sells, unless you create a private listing, in which case you will only be charged the listing fee when the private listing is sold. Etsy.com listings expire after four months. Pattern-only listings do not expire. If you list multiple quantities of the same item, the initial listing fee will be $0.20, and the listing will be automatically renewed at $0.20 after each of the items sells. You can read more about fees for multiple listings in this Help article. Listing fees are reflected in your payment account and deducted at the time the listing is published or renewed.\n\nAuto-renew. Etsy’s automatic renewals feature will automatically renew your listings at the end of the four-month listing period, unless you choose to not use automatic renewals for a particular listing or for your shop. You will be charged the listing fee of $0.20 for each of these listings until you cancel automatic renewals. You can see automatic listing status in your Listings Manager, and may cancel automatic renewals at any time by selecting “Manual” instead of “Automatic” in the “Renewal Options” in the Listings Manager. Once you cancel, you will only be charged for the current listing period.\nTransaction Fees\nWhen you make a sale through Etsy.com, you will be charged a transaction fee of 6.5% of the price you display for each listing plus the amount you charge for shipping and gift wrapping. If you are an Etsy Payments user and you list your items in a currency other than your payment account currency, see the Currency Conversion section below for more details on the transaction fee. If you sell from the US, the transaction fee will not apply to sales tax. If you sell from anywhere other than the US, the transaction fee will apply to the listing price (which should include any applicable taxes that you as a seller are responsible for), shipping price, and gift wrapping fee. If you offer optional personalization for an additional fee, the additional fee for personalization is added to the listing price you display and the total display price is subject to the same transaction fees described in this Section. See the Taxes section below for more information about whether you are required to include applicable taxes in your listing prices. Transaction fees are deducted from your current balance as each sale occurs, and are reflected in your payment account.\n\nAdvertising and Promotional Fees\nEtsy offers multiple services to help you advertise your listings and promote your shop, including Etsy Ads and Offsite Ads. If you use Etsy Ads, you select your daily maximum budget, as set forth in more detail below. For Offsite Ads, fees are only charged if Etsy's advertising your listing directly results in a sale, as set forth in more detail below. For more information, please see the Advertising & Marketing Policy.\n\nEtsy Ads Fees\n\nIf you purchase paid advertising on Etsy through the Advertising Dashboard in Shop Manager, you can set a budget to limit the amount you're willing to pay for Etsy Ads to promote your listings or shops on Etsy. Your daily maximum budget can be set at or above a predetermined minimum set by Etsy, and you will not be charged more than your maximum budget on a daily basis. All bids are made in United States dollars (USD). Etsy Ads fees may be charged on a recurring basis and are deducted from your current balance and reflected in your payment account. For more information, please see the Advertising & Marketing Policy.\n\nOffsite Ads Fees\n\nEtsy purchases offsite advertising from a network of participating partners, such as social networks and search engines. If such advertising includes your listing, a buyer clicks on it, and then places any orders from your shop within 30 days of that click, you will be charged an advertising fee on these orders (which we’ll refer to collectively as “Attributed Orders” and individually as an “Attributed Order”); provided, however, if within that 30 days a buyer’s last click before placing the order from your shop is an Etsy Ad then only the Etsy Ads fee will apply.\n\nThe Offsite Ads fee you are charged for Attributed Orders depends on your shop’s sales over the prior 365 days, as follows:\n\nThe standard fee you will pay is 15% on Attributed Orders, unless the 12% fee applies as described below.\nIf your shop has made less than $10,000 USD in sales over the prior 365 days (going back to February 20, 2019 and later), as calculated on the first day of the month, you will pay a fee of 15% (as described in the section below) on Attributed Orders, unless you opt out of participation in Offsite Ads for the duration your shop is under the $10,000 USD threshold. The 15% fee and opt-out apply until or unless you at any time meet the $10,000 USD threshold.\nIf at any time your shop has made sales of $10,000 USD or more over the prior 365 days (going back to February 20, 2019 and later), as calculated on the first day of the month, you will subsequently pay a fee of 12% (as described in the section below) on Attributed Orders, as of the beginning of the program if you immediately qualify, and otherwise on the first day of the month following qualification. If you subsequently fall below the $10,000 USD threshold at a later date, you will still only be charged a 12% advertising fee for the lifetime of your shop. If you opted out of participation in Offsite Ads prior to meeting the $10,000 USD threshold, you will be required to participate and will be charged a 12% advertising fee on Attributed Orders for the lifetime of your shop upon reaching the $10,000 USD threshold. The prior opt out while under the $10,000 USD threshold will no longer apply (even if you subsequently fall below the $10,000 USD threshold at a later date) to the extent permitted by law.\nBeginning a month after initial calculations when the program starts, Etsy will perform subsequent calculations on the first day of each calendar month and will give you notice if you have crossed the $10,000 USD threshold.\nFor the purpose of calculating this $10,000 USD threshold, sales are calculated by multiplying item price by quantity (minus any discounts or formally cancelled orders), but excluding Pattern orders, In Person Payment orders, Etsy fees, or separately charged shipping, taxes, or gift wrap. For sellers with shop currencies other than USD, the $10,000 USD threshold is calculated with the currency exchange rates used by Etsy at the time that the relevant sales were processed. Exchange rates used are variable and are provided by a third party financial services company. For information on how the $10,000 USD threshold is calculated, please see the next section and the Advertising & Marketing Policy.\n\nHow Offsite Ads fees are calculated:\n\nOffsite Ads fees apply to Attributed Orders and are charged as a percentage of the total order amount, which comprises the price you display for each listing plus the amount you charge for shipping and gift wrapping and in some jurisdictions, taxes, as set forth below. The applicable percentage charge, either 12% or 15%, is determined as described above.\n\nIf you are an Etsy Payments user and you list your items in a currency other than your payment account currency, see the Currency Conversion section below for more details on Offsite Ads fees. If you sell from the US, Offsite Ads fees will not apply to sales tax. If you sell from anywhere other than the US, Offsite Ads fees will apply to any applicable taxes that are included in your listing prices. If you offer optional personalization for an additional fee, the additional fee for personalization is added to the listing price you display and the total display price is subject to the same Offsite Ads fees described in this Section. There is no limit to the number of Offsite Ads fees you may be charged on Attributed Orders, but the total Offsite Ads fee you’ll pay on a single Attributed Order will not exceed $100 USD. Offsite Ads Fees are deducted from your current balance and are reflected in your payment account.\n\nSubscription Fees\nEtsy sellers in good standing may opt-in to Etsy Plus, a subscription package offering an expanded set of tools for growing brands. The fee for an Etsy Plus subscription is $10 USD per month. Etsy Plus subscription fees are deducted from your current balance each month and reflected in your payment account. Where applicable, Etsy may charge local taxes (e.g. sales taxes or VAT/GST) on your monthly subscription fee.\n\nAuto-renew. Subscription fees will be added to your payment account on the same day every month in your domestic currency. For example, if you sign up on March 5, your subscriptions fees will be added on April 5, May 5, and so on. When you sign up at the end of the month, your subscription fees will be charged to your payment account on the last day of the month. For example, if you sign up on May 31, your subscription fees will be added on June 30 because that is the last day of the month. You can cancel your Etsy Plus subscription anytime by visiting the Your Subscription section of your Shop Manager’s Settings. You will have access to your Etsy Plus subscription until the end of that subscription cycle, and your final day of access will be identified in the Your Subscription dashboard. After your Etsy Plus subscription has ended, your shop will return to Etsy Standard, and you will no longer have a subscription fee added to your payment account. To learn more about Etsy subscriptions, click here.\nWhile you are subscribed to Etsy Plus, you are provided with the following credits each subscription cycle:\n\n15 listing credits, which are visible as $3 in listings credit in your payment account\n$5 USD in Etsy Ads credits, which are visible in your payment account and on your advertising management page\nYou must use the credits during the subscription cycle, otherwise they expire. Credits will not roll over month to month. They will be reset and replenished at the beginning of each subscription cycle.\n\nEtsy Plus subscribers have the option to register free “.store” domains and get 50% off select domain extensions like “.com”, “.net”, and “.ca” through our third party provider partner, Hover. This discount is valid for the first year of domain registration. If you purchase a new custom web address through Hover, you’ll be navigated to Hover to select the details and complete the purchase. By subscribing to Etsy Plus, your first year of domain hosting subscription will be available for discount. When your domain needs to be renewed after a year, it will be subject to Hover’s normal pricing structure (without the Etsy Plus discount). Click here to learn more about Etsy Plus domains and features.\n\nIn-Person Selling Fees\nYou can use the Square reader to process payments for in-person sales. You have the option to sync your Etsy listings with Square. If you choose to sync your listings with Square, listings with multiple quantities will be charged the same $0.20 renewal fee as listings with multiple quantities on Etsy. Non-synced listings will be charged a $0.20 transaction fee, which will appear on your payment account as a “Square manual” fee. In-person selling fees are deducted from your current balance and reflected in your payment account. For more information about in-person selling fees, please see this Help article.\n\nIn-person sales processed with the Square reader will not be subject to Etsy’s 6.5% transaction fee or any Etsy payment processing fees, but will be subject to Square’s Payment Processing Fees.\n\nPayment Processing Fees\nOnline Sales. Eligible Etsy shops may use Etsy Payments to accept certain payments through Etsy (learn more about Etsy Payments below). Payment processing fees are charged for each transaction made through Etsy Payments. Payment processing fees vary based on the location of your bank account. In certain markets, a fixed deposit fee may be charged for the disbursement of seller funds that are under certain designated thresholds. See the Etsy Payments Policy to find payment processing fees and where applicable, deposit fees, by country. The payment processing fee is assessed on the total amount of the sale, including tax and shipping. Payment processing fees are deducted from the sale amount in your payment account. Deposit fees are deducted from your Available Funds and reflected in your payment account at the time of your scheduled deposit.\n\nShipping Fees\nEtsy offers sellers in certain locations the ability to purchase shipping labels to fulfill their orders. The cost of the shipping label will depend on the shipping carrier, and the origin, destination, weight, and dimensions of the package. If you add signature confirmation or insurance, those fees will be added to the total cost of the label at the point of purchase. Sellers who purchase shipping labels may also purchase parcel insurance through licensed insurance carriers. U.S. Sellers who purchase USPS shipping return labels will be charged after delivery of the returned package. You must accept Etsy Payments or PayPal as payment methods to purchase shipping labels through Etsy. Shipping fees and any adjustments are reflected in your payment account and deducted from your current balance.\n\nFor more information, please see the Shipping Policy.\n\nRegulatory Operating Fees\nSellers in certain countries will be charged a Regulatory Operating fee on each transaction. A Regulatory Operating fee is a fixed percentage of the price you display for each listing plus the amount you charge for shipping (including gift wrapping and personalization, if applicable) and is charged, where applicable, in addition to other fees described in this Policy. Regulatory Operating fees may vary per country and are charged as a result of the increased cost of operating in the relevant country, for example, as a result of additional costs of compliance with applicable regulation(s). You can find the countries in which Regulatory Operating fees apply as well as the specific percentage fees for each country in this help article.\n\nPattern Fees\nYou can try our Pattern tool to create a personalized website for free for 30 days. After the 30-day free trial, you’ll be charged a monthly subscription fee of $15.00 USD. Where applicable, Etsy may charge local taxes (e.g., sales taxes or VAT/GST) on your monthly subscription fee. Your first month’s fee will be pro-rated, and you will be charged the full subscription fee for each subsequent month you use Pattern. If you purchase a domain name through our partner Tucows, Inc., you will also be charged a fee to register the domain name and for any related services you purchase from Tucows.\n\nAuto-renew. Your subscription fee will automatically renew on the first of the month at 12:01am Eastern Time. You can turn your subscription off at any time by clicking \"cancel Pattern\" from the Pattern settings on your dashboard or from your payment account. If you switch off the service after your subscription renews on the first of the month, you'll still be responsible for paying the full subscription fee for that month.\nAll Pattern fees are reflected in your payment account and deducted from your current balance. For more information, please see the Pattern Policy.\n\nCurrency Conversion\nWith the exception of the set-up fee, transaction fee, Offsite Ads fees, the Payment Processing fee, Regulatory Operating fees, and deposit fees, Etsy converts fees from USD to your payment account currency at the market rate at the time the fee is reflected in your payment account. All fees appear in your payment account in your domestic currency. However, Etsy Payments users located in Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Romania will have all fees deducted from their payment account in their designated payment account currency, the Euro.\n\nTransaction fees, Offsite Ads fees, Regulatory Operating fees: If you list your items in a currency other than that of your payment account, the transaction fee and, where applicable, the Offsite Ads fee and Regulatory Operating fee will be converted to your payment account currency at the market rate and reflected in your payment account. Set-up fee: The set-up fee is charged to your card in the local currency of your bank and converted at the market rate at that time. If you onboard using Payoneer, the fee will be charged in USD.\n\nTo avoid incurring foreign exchange charges on your sales, Etsy recommends you list your items in the same currency as your payment account currency. Buyers see the items in the currency of their choosing. As an Etsy Payments user, if you decide to list in a currency other than that of your payment account, you will be charged a 2.5% currency conversion fee on the sale amount to send funds to your payment account. Learn more about currency conversion here. Currency conversion is handled automatically by our payment processing service and further described in our Etsy Payments Policy.\n\n2. Off-Platform Transactions\n\nBuy and sell items safely and securely on Etsy. Off-platform transactions are not protected by Etsy’s secure payment platform or policies, and offers to buy or sell outside Etsy are a potential fraud risk for buyers and sellers. Therefore, any action to move a transaction off the Etsy platform is strictly prohibited by Etsy. This includes, for example, encouraging buyers to purchase an item in your Etsy shop through another venue or directing buyers to another venue via a QR code. A transaction initiated on Etsy may not be completed off of Etsy. The price stated in each listing description must be an accurate representation of the sale. Sellers may not alter the item's price after a sale for the purpose of avoiding Etsy transaction fees, misrepresent the item’s location, or use another user's account without permission.\n\n3. Paying your Etsy Fees\n\nEtsy will automatically deduct all fees owed from your payment account, with the exception of the set-up fee which is charged to your card when you complete onboarding.. Provided you have sufficient funds in your payment account no further payment action is required. If your payment account does not contain sufficient funds you are responsible for paying any fees owed in full within 15 days of the date of your monthly statement, or the account will be considered past due, and Etsy may charge your card on file or take other actions to collect funds as laid out in the Recoupment section of Etsy's Payments Policy. If you make a sale while you have an outstanding balance the net sale amount will be applied to your outstanding balance. You may pay your outstanding balance manually by credit card, debit card, or PayPal. US sellers may also enroll in AutoBilling, Etsy's automatic outstanding fee payment option.\n\nYour statement is available in your payment account at the beginning of each month, and will detail all sales and fees activity from the preceding month. You can learn more about paying your outstanding balance in this Help article.\n\nEtsy may suspend your selling privileges at any time pending payment of your outstanding balance.\n\nAutoBilling (US Sellers Only)\nBy enrolling in Etsy’s automatic payment plan (\"AutoBilling\"), any outstanding fees not covered by the funds in your payment account will be charged to the credit card you have on file on the first of the month or when your current balance is greater than or equal to your fee threshold. To use the plan, you agree to the following terms.\n\nA. You authorize Etsy to keep your payment card information on file and to charge the card on file on the first day of each calendar month for the previous month’s outstanding charges and at any time the balance of fees reaches the designated fee threshold for your account. Upon enrollment, Etsy will charge your current balance to the card on file.\n\nB. When your card account is debited, Etsy will send you an email with the amount charged. You can also review this information by accessing your account on Etsy.\n\nC. If your card account on file with us is closed, the account number is changed, or a charge is rejected by your card issuer, you must update your card information or add a new card number in your Etsy account. If your charge is refused by the issuer for any reason, your Etsy account may be suspended or terminated, and you are still required to pay your outstanding balance by some other means. Your authorization applies to any successor or replacement card you or your card issuer provides.\n\nD. You may cancel AutoBilling and change to manual payment by updating your payment settings in your Etsy account. Etsy requires a reasonable period of time to act after we receive your notice. This means that an additional automatic payment may be made to your card account while we are processing your request.\n\nE. Suspended or terminated members remain obligated to pay Etsy for all unpaid fees.\n\nFor more information on AutoBilling, please see this Help article.\n\n4. Etsy Payments\n\nEtsy Payments enables sellers to accept various forms of payment in their local currencies while using Etsy’s services. Sellers registered for Etsy Payments accept payment from buyers by major credit or debit cards accepted by Etsy, Etsy Gift Cards, Etsy Credits and Etsy Coupons (subject to applicable limitations, see Etsy Gift Cards, Credits & Coupons Policy), by certain bank transfer services, through PayPal (where available), Apple Pay, Google Pay, and through Klarna (where available).\n\nYou can register for Etsy Payments by clicking here. Sellers using Etsy Payments are also subject to the Etsy Payments Policy.\n\n5. Taxes\n\nAside from the limited circumstances set out below, you are responsible for collecting and paying any taxes associated with using and making sales through Etsy’s services, including any fines, penalties and/or interest assessed directly or indirectly on such taxes (even if retroactive).\n\nFor purposes of these Terms, please note that while some countries may refer to VAT using other terms, e.g., Goods and Services Tax (\"GST\") or Harmonized Sales Tax (\"HST\"), we'll just refer to VAT, GST, HST and any local sales taxes collectively as \"VAT\" unless the context requires otherwise.\n\nA. Listing your items on Etsy\nTo comply with applicable US tax laws, Etsy will calculate, collect and remit sales tax on your behalf for orders shipped to customers residing in US locations. Click here to learn more about where Etsy collects sales tax on your behalf from US buyers.\n\nThe sales tax settings in Shop Manager are used for states/regions where Etsy doesn't automatically collect sales tax on your behalf.\n\nIf you sell on Etsy and reside in Canada, you need to include applicable taxes in your listing prices, except in cases where local tax legislation requires Etsy to collect the taxes on your behalf. As different jurisdictions in Canada at both a federal and provincial level apply different collection requirements for online marketplaces (e.g., GST/HST and provincial sales taxes) in Canada), Etsy may apply taxes to sales on a tax-excluded basis using the appropriate factors so that the taxes you include in your prices are not taxed again. For an example of how this works in Canada, please see this Help article.\n\nIf you sell on Etsy and reside outside of the US or Canada, you may need to include applicable taxes in your listing prices.\n\nYou can learn more about how taxes are displayed and communicated to buyers in different jurisdictions in this Help article.\n\nWhere Etsy is required to collect sales tax/VAT on your behalf, Etsy will use the category you assigned to each listing to calculate, collect, and remit the applicable taxes. You are solely responsible for ensuring that all of your listings are properly categorized, and you agree to indemnify Etsy for any losses it incurs in connection with any miscategorization of your listings by you.\n\nPlease remember that Etsy's fees do not include any withholding taxes that might apply in your home country. You are required to pay Etsy the full amount of our fees and may not deduct any applicable withholding taxes from that amount.\n\nIn certain jurisdictions, where required to comply with applicable laws, Etsy may withhold taxes from payments made to you or on your sales made through Etsy.com.\n\nB. Taxes on Seller Services\nUS Sales Tax on Subscription Fees\nWhere applicable, state sales tax will be applied to the Pattern subscription fee and the Etsy Plus subscription fee charged by Etsy.\n\nVAT on Seller Fees\nDepending on your business status and location, Etsy may be required to apply VAT on seller fees charged each month and remit it to the relevant tax authority. VAT is collected on all Etsy fees for sellers located in countries where VAT should be applied. Note that fees listed in this policy are exclusive of VAT. To learn more about how VAT works on Etsy, see this Help article.\n\nC. Taxes We Collect and Remit from Buyers\nUnited States Sales Tax\nIn most US states, as applicable, Etsy will collect the sales tax amount from the buyer and pay this to the relevant tax authority. If the sale was made through Etsy Payments, the sales tax amount will appear in your payment account and is deducted from your current balance.\n\nFor items shipped to certain states, including but not limited to Washington state (or, for digital items, those purchased with a Washington state billing address), Etsy will use the category you assigned to each listing to calculate, collect, and remit the applicable sales tax based on the buyer's location in the US. For a full list of these states, please see here.\n\nTaxes Collected and Remitted from buyers outside the US\n\nCollection of VAT on Physical Goods: Read about Other Taxes we Collect and Remit from buyers in Canada here and for other countries outside the US and Canada here.\n\nDigital VAT Fees\nUnder local laws in certain countries, Etsy is required to collect and remit VAT to the relevant tax authorities when you sell a digital item delivered via automatic download to the buyer. See this Help article for further details. Etsy will automatically display the increased amount charged to the buyer of the digital item to collect the correct amount of VAT, and we will remit it to the tax authorities. If the sales were made through Etsy Payments, Etsy will collect the VAT amount from the buyer and pay the VAT to the relevant tax authority, and you will not have to take any further action. If the sale was not made through Etsy Payments, you will receive the additional amount paid by the buyer for the VAT, and you will need to pay this amount to Etsy. The VAT amount paid by the buyer will appear on your payment account and will be deducted from your current balance.\n\n6. Other Governmental Fees, Charges and Levies\n\nCertain jurisdictions may require Etsy to collect other fees, charges or levies (e.g., environmental fees) from buyers and to remit those amounts to the relevant governmental authorities. Where Etsy is required by law to collect such amounts, they will be charged to buyers at checkout.\n\n7. Marketplace Reporting of Seller Information\n\nWhere legally required, Etsy will report your personal details and details of your transactions to relevant goverrnmental authorities.\n\nFor US sellers, Etsy will issue 1099-K forms to certain sellers to comply with IRS and applicable state requirements. You may opt in at any time to receive your 1099-K form electronically. You can learn more in this Help article.\n\nEtsy will not disclose any personal information to any third parties unless legally required to do so.\n\n8. Etsy Gift Cards, Etsy Credits & Etsy Coupons\n\nIf you are registered to use Etsy Payments, you may accept payment by Etsy Gift Cards, Etsy Credits, and Etsy Coupons. Etsy Gift Cards, Etsy Credits, and Etsy Coupons are subject to the Etsy Gift Cards, Credits & Coupons Policy. Etsy also charges the Etsy Payments payment processing fee described above on Etsy Gift Card, Etsy Credit, and Etsy Coupon transactions.\n\nLast updated on Jan 6, 2025"

Etsy Teams are self-organized by members and not run by, part of, or affiliated with Etsy.\n\nBy using Etsy’s Teams feature, you acknowledge and agree that:\n\nExcept as set forth below, Etsy is not responsible for or involved in a team’s membership policies, dues, finances, or any other actions.\nTeams that do not comply with Etsy's policies, including our Discrimination and Hateful Content Policy, may be removed, and Etsy reserves the right to remove a team or limit access to the creation of new teams for any reason.\nEtsy will not mediate disputes between teams and outside parties, nor disputes between teams and team members.\nEtsy will not monitor third-party forums or other independent team sites.\nAny use of the term \"Etsy,\" Etsy’s visual marks such as the stylized Etsy name logo or “E” logo, other Etsy Trademarks (all trademarks worldwide owned by Etsy, Inc. and its affiliates), or marks confusingly similar to the Etsy Marks must comply with Etsy’s Trademark Policy and our Team branding guidelines. See below for more details.\nA team may not use mature, profane, or hateful language or images in the team's name, banner, or logo.\nA team may not be used for the sole purpose of redirecting traffic to another web location. Etsy reserves the right to remove links on any profile page or team page for any reason. Unsolicited promotion or advertisement from representatives or affiliates of outside services, websites, or other products is not allowed.\nTeams are created by and run by Team Captains. A team must have a Captain in place in order to function successfully.\nTeam Captains are responsible for moderating their Team’s content. In addition, Team Captains may appoint additional roles and responsibilities to their members.\nTeams that are inactive for 6 months or more, or who do not have a Team Captain in place to moderate the Team, are subject to removal from the platform and cancellation at Etsy’s discretion. This includes revocation of the right to use Etsy’s name or the Etsy Trademarks.\nTeam forums and on-site publications (i.e., blogs and knowledge base articles) are subject to this Community Policy and may not be used to demonstrate or discuss disputes with other members or with Etsy.\nA team may have a charter detailing membership requirements and expectations for the team.

Branding Guidelines for Teams and Captains of Teams\n\nTeams must adhere to these branding guidelines when identifying as an Etsy Seller Team.\n\nYou can use the word Etsy in the name of your Team. (e.g. Etsy Greek Team, Brighton Etsy Team). However, you cannot use the term ‘Etsy’ alone, or the Etsy logo by itself in your Team name, or in any promotional materials that reference your Team in any manner.\n\nThings to keep in mind when creating an Etsy Team Logo:\n\nYou cannot use the Etsy logo to promote your Team without your Team name included at any time.\nYou can create a stand-alone Etsy Team logo so long as your Team name is clearly presented on the logo image.\nIf you use the word “Etsy” in your Team logo, you must make sure it is not the most prominent or the largest word visually on the logo image.\nIf you are promoting your Team or any Team related activities, you must include the terms “Organized by a Team of Etsy sellers” visibly and prominently. It is also your responsibility to make it clear that you are not an agent or employee of Etsy.\nYou are solely responsible for any costs relating to your use of all promotional materials, venues or other items used to promote your Team.\nEtsy does not pre-approve Team branding and we reserve the right to take action on any usage brought to our attention that causes confusion, potential harm to the Etsy brand, or is in direct violation of our Trademark Policy. In particular:\n\nTeams’ use of the Etsy name and Etsy Trademarks is subject to periodic Etsy’s review at any time, and Etsy may require changes in your use of the Etsy Trademarks to comply with Etsy policies, including our Trademark Policy, Etsy’s marketing needs, or to ensure Etsy’s Trademarks are not used in a way that suggests your Team is affiliated with, or part of Etsy, Inc. In addition, you may not use the Etsy Trademarks or similar marks in a way that tarnishes or causes harm to Etsy’s brand or reputation, or in relation to non-Etsy services. At Etsy’s sole discretion, including if you violate this policy, or any of Etsy’s Terms of Use, Etsy reserves the right to revoke your right to use the Etsy Trademarks.\n\n7. Seller Events\n\nEtsy may promote seller-focused virtual or in-person events and activities including educational workshops, markets and summits. Sellers participate in events at their own discretion.\n\nEtsy does not sponsor seller-led events unless otherwise specified. While Etsy sellers may describe their events as \"organized by Etsy sellers\", sellers may not prominently use the Etsy name or logo in a manner that suggests the event is organized or run by Etsy. Etsy may periodically review the use of the Etsy name and Etsy Trademark, and may revoke the right to use the Etsy name or Etsy Trademarks at any time, for any reason.\n\nEtsy may take action, including termination or suspension, on any account that violates these policies. For example, we may temporarily or permanently suspend your community posting privileges, remove your community access or close your Etsy account, which will immediately suspend all Etsy shop activity. If we do so, it’s important to understand that you don’t have a contractual or legal right to continue to use our Services, including Community spaces or the Etsy Trademarks. Generally, Etsy will notify you that your account has been terminated or suspended, unless you’ve repeatedly violated this policy or our Terms or we have legal or regulatory reasons preventing us from notifying you.\n\nLast updated on Jan 22, 2025"
